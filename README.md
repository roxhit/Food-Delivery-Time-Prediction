# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction
This Project will predict the food delivery time in real
time. I calculated the distance between the food preparation point and the point of food
consumption. After finding the distance between the restaurant and the delivery locations, I
found relationships between the time taken by delivery partners to deliver the food in the
past for the same distance.
I used several python libraries(numpy , pandas , seaborn , matplotlib).I
trained a Machine
Learning model using an LSTM neural network model for the task of food delivery time
prediction
